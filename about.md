Experience
---------

**Data Engineer**, *Employentric*

Remote, based in Stockholm - November 2018 to Current

I work with a startup team to create an HR platform that generates intelligent surveys and provides resources to managers, allowing teams to connect with upper management in an organic way. 

- Design and develop scalable data pipelines for incoming data from many different channels 
- Build machine learning algorithms to determine themes from survey data 
- Implement features and updates across the full stack 
- Communicate across time zones with company founder in Sweden

**Data Science Apprentice**, *Metis Data Science Bootcamp*

Seattle, WA - Jan 2018 to April 2018

- Designed and implemented Linear Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, K- Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Tree models. 
- Gained experience with Machine Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Neural Networks.

Technical Projects
--------------------


**Undergraduate Research Thesis: Detecting Variable Stars in the TaurusÂ­/Auriga Region**
- Used a regular DSLR camera to detect Variable Stars in the constellations Taurus and Auriga.
- Used a full stack of open source astronomical software packages
- Culminated in a 90 page paper and the discovery of 3 previously unknown variable stars.

**Analyzing Humor and Recommending Jokes**
- Used Natural Language Processing and Unsupervised Clustering algorithms to analyze jokes.
- Designed a joke recommender using collaborative filtering.
- Built an interactive flask application using D3 to visualize the recommender.

**Detecting Exoplanets Using Deep Learning with NASA**
- Used a regular DSLR camera to detect Variable Stars in the constellations Taurus and Auriga.
- Used a full stack of open source astronomical software packages
- Culminated in a 90 page paper and the discovery of 3 previously unknown variable stars.

**Fame, Fortune and International Success of Musicians**
- Obtained data about the world's top grossing musicians by scraping a webpage.
- Used a Linear Regression model to predict what factors influence musicians' global success. 
- Tested the model's success using out-of-sample data and various performance metrics.

**Patient No-Shows in Brazilian Medical Offices**
- Predicted if a patient would show up to their scheduled doctor's appointment based on a variety of features.
- Tested 5 different models for categorical classification, then created a web application with flask and D3 visualizations to present the results.
