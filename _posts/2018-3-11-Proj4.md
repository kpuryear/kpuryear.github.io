title: Project 4 - Joke Analysis with NLP and Recommender Systems Using Unsupervised Machine Learning
---

## Problem to be Solved
I have always been interested in what makes people laugh. It seems the phrase "sense of humor" means something completely different to each person. I was interested in investigating the construction of jokes, and determining if there are patterns to the type of humor individuals enjoy. To do this, I obtained a dataset that contained 25,000 people's responses to 100 different jokes. Each person rated the funny-ness of the joke on a scale from -10 to 10. I used this dataset to develop a joke recommedation algorithm and analyzed the 100 jokes with the NLP arsenal.
