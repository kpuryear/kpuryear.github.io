title: Project 4 - Joke Analysis with NLP and Recommender Systems Using Unsupervised Machine Learning
---

## Problem to be Solved
I have always been interested in what makes people laugh. It seems the phrase "sense of humor" means something completely different to each person. I was interested in investigating the construction of jokes, and determining if there are patterns to the type of humor individuals enjoy. To do this, I obtained a dataset that contained 25,000 people's responses to 100 different jokes. Each person rated the funny-ness of the joke on a scale from -10 to 10. After analysis, I could finally answer the age old question: "Whats so funny?"

## Business Applications
Aside from being an interesting and entertaining topic of investigation, this research has applications for businesses as well. For example, companies with AI bots could use this research to inject (tasteful) humor into their applications such as Siri and Alexa. This would make the AI applications feel more friendly and relatable. Additionally, marketing teams could use this information to create customer humor demographics to direct more targeted ads toward their clients. Humor is a tool people use to create a relaxed and fun atmosphere, and to make eachother feel more comforable.
