title: Project 5 - Detecting Exoplanets with NASA
---

## Problem to be Solved:
Each of the stars in the night sky has the potential for multiple planets orbiting around it. These extra-solar planets are called "exoplanets". It is outrageously difficult to detect these planets because of the vast distances between stars, and planets, unlike stars, do not create their own light. In fact, the best way to detect exoplanets is actually through a *lack* of light. As a planet completes its orbit around the host star, there is a non-zero probability that the planet's orbit will cross the disc of the star. If you were able to witness the total solar eclipse in August 2017, you'll know that when some object crosses in front of its star (ex, the Moon), the light from the star (ex, our Sun) becomes significantly dimmer. This detection technique is called the "Transit Method". Using this technique NASA's Kepler Spacecraft has been able to detect 3,708 exoplanets to date. The Kepler Spacecraft is NASA's exoplanet detection spacecraft, and had been looking at 150,000 main Sequence stars from 2009 to 2013.

## Partnering with NASA
I reached out to NASA when I started working on this project. I knew that the format of the data would probably be in a NASA-specific format, and I needed tools and advice about how to handle it. I emailed the team at Kepler Guest Observer Office, and was surprised when they responded back in mere hours. Dr Christina Hedges and Dr Michael Gully-Santiago were incredibly helpful in getting me set up with access to the Kepler Database, and showed me a package they created called "lightkurve" which specifically deals with transit data from Kepler. Perfect! 

## Data Collection
The raw data that streams directly from Kepler is in the form of .fits images. "Fits" stands for Flux In Time Series. This data is not a typical "image", it has flux data imbedded in it. Flux is a measure of the energy coming from a specific point at a given moment, which is exactly the same as measuring the "brightness" of a star.
