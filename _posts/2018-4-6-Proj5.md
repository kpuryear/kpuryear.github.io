title: Project 5 - Detecting Exoplanets with NASA
---

## Problem to be Solved:
Each of the stars in the night sky has the potential for multiple planets orbiting around it. These extra-solar planets are called "exoplanets". It is outrageously difficult to detect these planets because of the vast distances between stars, and planets, unlike stars, do not create their own light. In fact, the best way to detect exoplanets is actually through a *lack* of light. As a planet completes its orbit around the host star, there is a non-zero probability that the planet's orbit will cross the disc of the star. If you were able to witness the total solar eclipse in August 2017, you'll know that when some object crosses in front of its star (ex, the Moon), the light from the star (ex, our Sun) becomes significantly dimmer.
