### Problem to be Solved
A case study conducted in April of 2016 in Southern and Coastal Brazil concluded that 30% of patients do not show up for their scheduled doctors appointments. Since many patients have health insurance provided by the Brazilian government, this causes a strain in the country's economic resources, and is a general waste of time for doctors. My goal was to create a model that predicts how likely a patient is to arrive for their scheduled appointment.

### Data Aquisition and Back-End Work
I downloaded the original data as a CSV file from Kaggle, and it contained 15 features: PatientID, AppointmentID, Gender, AppointmentOn, ScheduledOn, Age, Neighborhood, Scholarship, Hypertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism, Disability, SMS_received, No-show. I set the response variable, y, equal to the True or False values in the "No-show" column. I will attempt to predict these values as accurately as possible. Next, I trimmed down the features a bit. I transformed as many columns as possible into Boolean values (True/False). I also created a new column called "delta" by subtracting the two dates: AppointmentOn-ScheduledOn. Then, I added another new column called "2+problems" which looked at the "Hypertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism, Disability" columns, and determined if they were seeing the doctor to treat more than one condition. I removed the PatientID, AppointmentID and Neighborhood columns since they were not translatable to the bigger picture.

With a squeaky clean dataset, I created a SQL database in my AWS EC2 instance. Hosting the data in "the cloud" meant I didn't need to store the dataset on my local machine. Instead, I built a psycopg engine to query my SQL database and pipe it directly into a Jupyter notebook.
