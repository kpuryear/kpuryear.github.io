### Problem to be Solved
A case study conducted in April of 2016 in Southern and Coastal Brazil concluded that 30% of patients do not show up for their scheduled doctors appointments. Since many patients have health insurance provided by the Brazilian government, this causes a strain in the country's economic resources, and is a general waste of time for doctors. My goal was to create a model that predicts how likely a patient is to arrive for their scheduled appointment.

### Data Aquisition and Back-End Work
I downloaded the original data as a CSV file from Kaggle, and it contained 15 features: PatientId, AppointmentID, Gender, AppointmentOn, ScheduledOn, Age, Neighborhood, Scholarship, Hypertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism, Handicap, SMS_received, No-show.

### NoShows.csv
- Original untouched data, downloaded directly from kaggle

### Proj3-Data_cleaning.py:
- Shows my data cleaning process
- Shows my feature engineering
- Returns a cleaned CSV file

### noshowclean_n.csv
- Cleaned CSV file
- Formatted for uploading data to a SQL table

### Proj3-Modeling.py:
- Shows my process for modelling the data
- SQLalchemy engine inplemented
- Stratified Train Test Split with upsampling
- Fit models: KNN, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- Analyzed ROC Curves and various scoring metrics

### MVP3.pptx:
- A rough presentation of my initial findings 

### Presentation3.pptx
- Complete presentation I gave to wrap up the project and communicate my completed results

### dataviz (folder)
- Folder contains files needed for my interactive D3 visualization:
- Noshow.p (pickled model)
- Awesome.html (webpage rendering html)
- Main.py (flask-assisted python functionality to feed into the html)
