title: Data Science in Seattle's Oldest Neighborhood
---

The Seattle branch of Metis, sits right in the heart of Old Seattle. Sandwiched between historic pioneer square and Safeco Field, our classroom is in Seattle's Oldest Neighborhood. The buildings in this part of the city feature ornate carvings and complex masonry. 

On my second day of class, I was struck by how many brick buildings I passed by on my walk to class. I generally walk between 7-10 blocks to get to Metis from the bus stop, and in that time I passed over 15 stunning brick buildings. The next day, I decided to take a picture of every brick building I passed on my way to class. During this exercise, I took around 20 pictures. Here are some of the best ones!

Seattle is lovely, and it is so much fun to live and work here!
