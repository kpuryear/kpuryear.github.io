title: Data Science in Seattle's Oldest Neighborhood

The Seattle branch of Metis, sits right in the heart of "Old Seattle". Our classroom is sandwiched between historic Pioneer Square and Safeco Field. The buildings in this part of the city feature ornate carvings and complex masonry, contrasting starkly with the shiny steel skyscrapers of downtown. 

On my second day of class, I was struck by how many brick buildings I passed on my walk. I generally walk between 7-9 blocks to get to Metis from the bus stop, and in that time I passed over 15 stunning brick buildings. The next day, I decided to take a picture of every brick building I passed on along my route. During this exercise, I took around 20 pictures. Here are some of my favorites!

### Washington Square?
