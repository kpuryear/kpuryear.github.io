title: How to Transmit Data from Space
---

I have always loved the Mars Rovers Spirit and Opportunity. Those two small, rolling robots were my main inspiration to study astronomy. When I was in 5th grade, my dad took me to see Steve Squyers give a lecture at Microsoft. I learned that the 2 rovers were only supposed to last about 6 months on the surface of Mars. However, because of their ingenious design, the rovers were able to last more than 600% of their estimated Mars time. After that, I was completely hooked. I learned everything I could about Mars and NASA and how to build rockets. I was a black hole consuming all the knowledge I could.
