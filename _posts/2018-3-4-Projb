Technical Projects
--------------------


**Undergraduate Research Thesis: Detecting Variable Stars in the Taurus­/Auriga Region**
- Used a regular DSLR camera to detect Variable Stars in the constellations Taurus and Auriga.
- Used a full stack of open source astronomical software packages
- Culminated in a 90 page paper and the discovery of 3 previously unknown variable stars.

**Analyzing Humor and Recommending Jokes**
- Used Natural Language Processing and Unsupervised Clustering algorithms to analyze jokes.
- Designed a joke recommender using collaborative filtering.
- Built an interactive flask application using D3 to visualize the recommender.

**Detecting Exoplanets Using Deep Learning with NASA**
- Used a regular DSLR camera to detect Variable Stars in the constellations Taurus and Auriga.
- Used a full stack of open source astronomical software packages
- Culminated in a 90 page paper and the discovery of 3 previously unknown variable stars.

**Fame, Fortune and International Success of Musicians**
- Obtained data about the world's top grossing musicians by scraping a webpage.
- Used a Linear Regression model to predict what factors influence musicians' global success. 
- Tested the model's success using out-of-sample data and various performance metrics.

**Patient No­-Shows in Brazilian Medical Offices**
- Predicted if a patient would show up to their scheduled doctor's appointment based on a variety of features.
- Tested 5 different models for categorical classification, then created a web application with flask and D3 visualizations to present the results.



Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want
----------------------------------------

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.

* Random tidbit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
