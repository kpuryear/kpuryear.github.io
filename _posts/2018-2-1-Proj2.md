title: Project 2 - Linear Regression and Cross Validation
---

For this project, I created a model to predict how many total albums an artist will sell across the globe! For weeks 2 and 3, we focused on predicting numerical data with Linear Regression Models. As a fun choice, I decided to look at the top grossing contemporary musicians of all time. 

### Data Aquisition and Data Cleaning
I aquired my musician data from Wikipedia's article called "List of best-selling music artists", last updated in Feb 2018. This page had convenient tables located throughout the article, and it was relatively simple to parse through the HTML to separate out the tables. I used Beautiful Soup to scrape the data directly from HTML into a Pandas dataframe

Once the data was entered into Pandas dataframes, the real cleaning began. There were 5 discrete tables from the webpage, so I concatenated them all together and renumbered the indeces. From there, I devised a regex formula to remove the numbered references that seemed to trail every datapoint. In the webpage they had been actual working links, but to me they were junk. The data was already looking so much cleaner! 

The regex formula I used: (shown here acting on the "Artist" column)

```
killbrackets = re.compile(r' \[[0-9b]+\]')
df["Artist"] = [killbrackets.sub("", i) for i in df["Artist"]]
```

Then, I transformed the "Period Active" column into "Years Active", for example: instead of 1960-1970, it was just 10. For some rows, the data response listed a starting year then said "to present", which I replaced with 2018 and proceeded with my subtraction.
